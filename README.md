# OpenStreetMap OSM files to MATLAB

This is a very basic importer for OSM files in MATLAB. See `demo.m`
for usage.

The utiltiy does not extract all the information from these files
(notably relation are missing), but it is good enough if the goal is
to get the road graph. On the plus side, it is so simple that it
should be easy to customize.
